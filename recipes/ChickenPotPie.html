    <h2>A comforting, hot and succulent homemade Chicken Pot Pie.</h2>
    <p>A delicious chicken pie made from scratch with carrots, peas, and celery in a pre-made crust. Add thyme and poultry seasoning for more flavor.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Here's what you'll need to make the best chicken pot pie of your life:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong><br>
            Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into cubes) are ideal for making classic chicken pot pie.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Vegetables</strong><br>
            This chicken pot pie recipe calls for the usual suspects: peas, carrots, onions, and celery. You could toss in some mushrooms or green peppers if you want to incorporate more veggies.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Butter and Flour</strong><br>
            The chicken pot pie filling starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong><br>
            Achieve the perfect cozy flavor with salt, pepper, and celery seed. Of course, you can add more seasonings to suit your taste.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Broth and Milk</strong><br>
            Chicken broth and milk add depth of flavor and help create a smooth and decadent chicken pot pie filling consistency.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Pie Crusts</strong><br>
            You'll need two unbaked pie crusts. If you opt for the homemade route, you can't go wrong with our Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe â€” but store-bought is perfectly fine.

    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery in a saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed.</li>
       <br>
        <li>Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
       <br>
        <li>Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
       <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
       <br>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
